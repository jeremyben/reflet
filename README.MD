# Reflet 💫

Reflet is a set of modules using the power of **[decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html)** to **complement** already useful nodejs libraries.

Reflet helps you **organize** your app in a more **declarative** way.

But most importantly, Reflet is french for reflection (pronounce _reflay_ 🐔).
